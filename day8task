  *what is time complexity?
-->Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.

  *what are the types of time complexity?
-->There are five types of Time complexity Cases:
   1.Constant Time Complexity - O(1)
   2.Logarithmic Time Complexity - O(log n)
   3.Linear Time Complexity - O(n)
   4.O(n log n) Time Complexity.
   5.Quadratic Time Complexity - O(n2)
